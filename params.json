{"name":"Kitsune","tagline":"Kitsune twitter response bot","body":"## KITSUNE Twitter Interaction Bot\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nThis twitter bot scans recent tweets for the keywords defined in key_word.txt and exctracts\r\nthe senders' user names. It then tweets a response using those names and the text from\r\nresponse.txt.\r\n\r\nThe order of keywords and messages in these files is important. I.E. Tweets containing the\r\nphrase on line 1 of key_word.txt are sent the response from line 1 of response.txt.\r\n\r\nThis allows for automated responses to certain hashtags, key words and phrases; useful for \r\nrunning competitions, advertising or any other project that needs to send large numbers of \r\na large variety of tweets autonomously.\r\n\r\nEach 'keyword' can be a full boolean search string.\r\ne.g. 'key +words -RT' would return all tweets containing both 'key' and 'words' but not 'RT'.\r\n\r\n### Possible Future Features\r\n- Include images with responses.\r\n- Send email updates of tweets found, responses sent etc. for analytics.\r\n- Allow for remote addition/editing of keywords and response messages via email.\r\n\r\n### Please Note\r\nThe kitsune bot relies on a Twitter API. On the first run of the program you will need to\r\ninput all four keys from the API aassociated with your Twitter account. This can be set up\r\non https://apps.twitter.com and is free of charge at the time of writing.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThe control.py script needs to be set to run on boot and the pi needs to automatically reboot\r\nevery 24hrs (via cron). This will ensure software updates that require a reboot are \r\nimplemented after download without the need for human intervention.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this was designed for a specific use, on a specific SD card and hasn't yet been made flexible enough for distribution to other Raspberry Pis. In particular, the self-updates relies on the scrips being saved in a specific directory that is set up as a local Git repository.\r\n","google":"UA-56156817-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
